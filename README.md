In this simple endless runner game, a user tries to reach the top of the high score leaderboard all while facing the challenge of not crashing into any of the block coming across the screen. if a user succeeded in getting a score above the last player on the high score leaderboard, the user will then be prompted to put their name in and have it saved to the server and upon a refresh of the window with a new fetch request, the user will be able to see their name up on the leaderboard.

### Instructions:

As soon as the page loads, the game will begin with bricks racing accross the screen towards the Dino, your goal is to jump over the bricks by hitting any key right before a brick gets to the Dino. Continue jumping until you collide into a brick, if you did not reach a highscore, press any key to start another game. If you did reach a highscore you will be prompted to fill in your name to save your score. 

## Happy Jumping!!!
