# RunnerGame

In this simple endless runner game, a user tries to reach the top of the high score leaderboard all while facing the challenge of not crashing into any of the block coming across the screen. if a user succeded in getting a score above the last player on the high score leaderboard, the user will then be prompted to put their name in and have it saved to the server and upon a refresh of the window with a new fetch request, the user will be able to see their name up on the leaderboard.
